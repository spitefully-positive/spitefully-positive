- I'm a native german speaker 👄
- You can just call me "spite"
- Or on a personal level call me "joe"
- And if you're german, call me "Johannes"  
  (Experience shows english speakers break their tongues pronouncing my name :D)
- You can contact me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/spitefullypositive.bsky.social) if you need me
